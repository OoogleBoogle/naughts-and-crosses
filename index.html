            <h1>Suggested Rules</h1>
            <p>There are no rules in EXTREME NAUGHTS AND CROSSES. One thing to note the first piece on each board is a cross.
                Here are some suggestions...</p>
            <p>
                Game Style 1: Place as many boards as you like.
                Then each player must place a piece on each board (but not in the same place) before moving to the next player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game Style 2 (True EXTREME NAUGHTS AND CROSSES): Place 1 Board. At any time a player can place a new board and take the first turn on that one.
                Each 'go' you can only place one piece at a time, no matter how many boards there are.
                Remember, the first go on a new board is a cross. So if naughts starts a second (or third..into infinity) board
                they play as crosses on the new board.
